# Machine-Learning-Enhancements-in-DiD
**Overview:** This project focuses on implementing Machine Learning Enhancements in the study "Retail Pharmacies and Drug Diversion during the Opioid Epidemic" by Aljoscha Janssen and Xuan Zhang. The study examines the impact of retail pharmacy ownership in the dispensing of opioids during the opioid epidemic. This was performed by comparing independent pharmacies to chain pharmacies. They found that independent pharmacies dispense significantly more opioids, particularly OxyContin, which is strongly associated with nonmedical use. The authors suggest that ownership changes, such as when an independent pharmacy becomes part of a chain, lead to decreases in opioid dispensing. 
**Methodology:** The researchers utilized a dataset comprising prescription opioid orders, focusing on the differences in dispensing between independent and chain pharmacies. They also examined the effects of the OxyContin reformulation into an abuse-deterrent formula on pharmacy dispensing practices. Their methods included regression analyses and quasi-experimental designs to isolate the impact of pharmacy type and ownership changes on opioid dispensing patterns. 
**Results & Discussions:** The findings indicate that independent pharmacies dispensed 39.1% more total opioids and 60.5% more OxyContin compared to chain pharmacies. Post-reformulation of OxyContin, the gap in dispensing between the two types of pharmacies narrowed, suggesting a substantial portion of the previously higher dispensing by independent pharmacies was driven by nonmedical demand. Additionally, the transition of an independent pharmacy to chain ownership resulted in a significant reduction in opioid dispensing, underscoring the influence of corporate governance and regulatory compliance on dispensing behaviors.
